This is a pretty useful OmniFocus AppleScript that I developed by
hacking on <a
href="http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=18580">another
script</a> that I found <a
href="http://simplicityisbliss.com/2010/12/16/top-5-omnifocus-applescripts/#quicklyfindaproject">on
a blog</a>. If you select a project and then execute the script, it will
let you type in a string to search for a folder to move the project to.
